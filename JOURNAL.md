## Session 2 — Fix launch crash: move grid creation off main thread (li-0r3)

Fixed visionOS watchdog termination on real Vision Pro hardware. Polecat: furiosa.

Root cause: GridRenderer.makeGrid() created 16^3 = 4096 ModelEntity instances
synchronously inside RealityView's make closure, which runs on the main actor.
This blocked the main thread for >2 seconds, triggering visionOS hang detection.

Changes:
- GridRenderer.makeGridAsync() — computes cell positions on a detached Task,
  then creates entities on MainActor (RealityKit requires it)
- ContentView uses .task modifier with @State to load grid asynchronously
- ProgressView loading indicator shown while grid builds
- RealityView update closure adds grid entity once ready

Approach: The heavy work (position math for 4096 cells) moves to a detached task.
Entity creation stays on MainActor since RealityKit requires it, but with positions
pre-computed, the main thread work is just instantiation — much faster.

## Session 1 — Bootstrap visionOS app with RealityKit 3D grid (li-gg1)

Created the initial visionOS app target with RealityKit rendering. Polecat: furiosa.

Changes:
- Xcode project with visionOS app target (Life3D)
- Life3DApp.swift — SwiftUI app entry point with WindowGroup
- ContentView.swift — Main view with RealityView
- GridModel.swift — 3D grid data structure (16x16x16)
- GridRenderer.swift — RealityKit cube rendering with semi-transparent emissive material
- GridTests.swift — Logic-only unit tests for grid dimensions
- Volumetric window style causes runtime crash on visionOS 2.1 sim — used plain WindowGroup with RealityView instead
- visionOS Simulator crashes host machine — build-verify only, no test execution in CI

Lesson: visionOS Simulator is too heavy for automated test runs on this machine. Need build-only verification or a lighter test strategy.
